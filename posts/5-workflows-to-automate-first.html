        <h1>5 Accounting Workflows You Should Automate First (And Why)</h1>

        <p>Not all automation is created equal.</p>
        
        <p>Some projects take months to implement and deliver marginal returns. Others can be set up in days and save your team 10+ hours per week immediately.</p>
        
        <p>After helping dozens of firms implement automation, we've identified a clear pattern: certain workflows consistently deliver the biggest bang for your buck. Here are the top five, ranked by impact and ease of implementation.</p>
        
        <div class="workflow-card">
            <h3>1. 📧 Invoice Processing & Data Entry</h3>
            <p class="time-saved">Typical time savings: 10-15 hours/week</p>
            <p>This is the low-hanging fruit. If you're still manually typing invoice data into your accounting system, you're leaving money on the table.</p>
            <p><strong>What automation looks like:</strong> Invoices arrive via email. AI extracts vendor, amount, date, line items, and GL codes. Data flows directly into your accounting system. A human reviews exceptions only.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Invoices are structured documents. AI can read them with 95%+ accuracy. The remaining 5% get flagged for review—which is still faster than processing everything manually.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="workflow-card">
            <h3>2. 🏦 Bank Reconciliation</h3>
            <p class="time-saved">Typical time savings: 5-8 hours/week</p>
            <p>Month-end reconciliation shouldn't take days. Modern tools can match 90%+ of transactions automatically.</p>
            <p><strong>What automation looks like:</strong> Bank feeds connect directly to your system. AI matches transactions to invoices, receipts, and journal entries. Unmatched items get flagged with suggested matches.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Most transactions follow patterns. Once the system learns your clients' patterns, matching becomes trivial. You only spend time on genuine anomalies.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="workflow-card">
            <h3>3. 📊 Report Generation</h3>
            <p class="time-saved">Typical time savings: 3-5 hours/week</p>
            <p>How much time do you spend pulling the same reports every month? Formatting the same spreadsheets? Copying data between systems?</p>
            <p><strong>What automation looks like:</strong> Reports generate automatically on a schedule. Data pulls from multiple sources. Formatting is consistent. Reports land in clients' inboxes without you lifting a finger.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Reports are deterministic. Same inputs, same outputs. There's no reason for a human to manually run a P&L every month when a script can do it perfectly every time.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="workflow-card">
            <h3>4. 📅 Client Follow-ups & Reminders</h3>
            <p class="time-saved">Typical time savings: 2-4 hours/week</p>
            <p>Chasing clients for documents is tedious, but necessary. Why do it manually?</p>
            <p><strong>What automation looks like:</strong> System tracks which documents are outstanding. Automatic reminders go out on a schedule. Escalation emails trigger if items stay open. You only step in when automation fails.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Follow-ups are time-based and rules-based. If [document X] is not received by [date Y], send [reminder Z]. A computer can enforce this logic more reliably than a busy human.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="workflow-card">
            <h3>5. 📁 Document Organization & Filing</h3>
            <p class="time-saved">Typical time savings: 2-3 hours/week</p>
            <p>Every document that arrives needs to be named, tagged, and filed correctly. It's mindless work—perfect for AI.</p>
            <p><strong>What automation looks like:</strong> Documents arrive via email or upload. AI reads them, identifies the type (invoice, receipt, contract, etc.), extracts metadata, and files them in the correct folder with the correct naming convention.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Document classification is a solved problem. AI can identify document types with near-perfect accuracy, and filing rules are easy to define.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>How to Prioritize</h2>
        
        <p>If you're just getting started with automation, here's our recommended order:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start with invoice processing.</strong> It's high-volume, high-impact, and the tools are mature.</li>
            <li><strong>Add bank reconciliation.</strong> Pairs naturally with invoice processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Automate client reminders.</strong> Quick win that improves client relationships.</li>
            <li><strong>Tackle report generation.</strong> Frees up time for analysis instead of formatting.</li>
            <li><strong>Implement document filing.</strong> Compounds benefits over time as your digital filing becomes immaculate.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>The 80/20 Rule of Automation</h2>
        
        <p>Here's a secret: you don't need to automate everything perfectly. In fact, trying to achieve 100% automation often leads to diminishing returns.</p>
        
        <p>The goal is to automate the predictable 80% and build efficient processes for the exceptional 20%. A system that handles 80% of invoices automatically—and flags the other 20% for quick human review—is vastly better than a system that tries to handle 100% and fails on edge cases.</p>
        
        <p>Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Start with one workflow, get it working, measure the results, and expand from there.</p>
